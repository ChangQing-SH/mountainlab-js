This example shows how to run the MountainSort v4 spike sorting algorithm using a python script

This assumes that you have already installed the requirements and configured your system for the basic examples

Note: this example depends on older processing libraries to be installed: ms3.* and pyms.* processors

Make sure you have the latest version of the mountainlab_mltools installed:
pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Open the ipython notebook using either "jupyter lab" or "jupyter notebook"
