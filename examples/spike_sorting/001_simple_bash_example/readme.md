This example shows how to run mountainlab processors from a bash script. It synthesizes ephys data and then runs spike sorting. All input and output files are stored in the data/ subdirectory.

Here we use all .prv files. You can use ml-prv-locate to find the location of those files in the temporary directory. But you can also remove the .prv extensions in the commands to get the actual data files.
