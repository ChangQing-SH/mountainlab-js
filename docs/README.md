Documentation for MountainLab starts in the main README.md file at the top of project. The rest lives in the docs_editable folder.

You can view it my navigating to `docs/docs_editable` on [github](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainlab-js) or by following the links on [our website](https://flatironinstitute.github.io/mountainlab-js/).
